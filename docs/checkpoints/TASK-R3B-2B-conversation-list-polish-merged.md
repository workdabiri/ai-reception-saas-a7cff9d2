## 4. Implementation Summary

### Channel Filter
- Added second filter pill row below status filter.
- Values: All channels / Internal / Web Chat.
- Matches backend `ChannelType` enum: `INTERNAL`, `WEBSITE_CHAT`.
- Combined with status filter into unified `FilterBar` component.
- Filter reset clears both status + channel + cursor + accumulated pages.

### Status Filter
- Retained from R3B-2A: All / New / Open / Assigned / Waiting (customer) / Waiting (operator) / Escalated / Resolved.
- No changes to status filter behavior.

### Append-Based Load More Pagination
- Local `pages` state accumulates conversation rows across fetches.
- Cursor state drives next-page API call via existing `useConversations` hook.
- No modification to R3B-1 hooks.
- No `useInfiniteQuery` introduced.
- Duplicate append guard: `Set`-based ID dedup before append prevents repeated rows.
- `lastKnownNextCursor` ref preserves Load More button visibility during in-flight fetch.
- `isInitialLoading = isLoading && pages.length === 0` — skeleton only shown on true first load.
- Previous list remains visible via local `pages` state during next-page fetch.

### Row Content Improvements
- Customer label improved: `Contact #xxxxxxxx` or `No customer linked`.
- Message count shown: `N msgs` (source: `ConversationWithSummary.messageCount`).
- No customer name lookup — N+1 risk; deferred to R3B-3.

### New Conversation Button
- Marked `disabled` with `opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed`.
- Title: "Coming soon".
- No misleading active control.

## 5. CTO Corrections Applied Before Merge

Two commits on PR #6 (`c92fbe6` → `f01afcc`):

| Issue | Correction |
|---|---|
| Initial implementation used `keepPreviousData` alongside cursor accumulation | Removed `keepPreviousData` import and `placeholderData` option entirely |
| `keepPreviousData` + truthy cursor caused effect to see stale previous-page data as "new" → duplicate rows | Replaced with Set-based dedup guard: `dataItems.filter(item => !seen.has(item.id))` |
| Load More button disappeared during next-page fetch when `data?.nextCursor` became undefined | Added `lastKnownNextCursor` ref — updated on each data response, cleared on filter reset |
| Initial loading skeleton blocked page even when accumulated pages existed | Changed guard to `isInitialLoading = isLoading && pages.length === 0` |
| `useEffect` dep was `data` object (unstable) | Changed dep to `data?.data` extracted as `dataItems` const for stable reference |

## 6. Validation Evidence

### Toolchain
- **Package manager:** Bun 1.3.14 (no npm/pnpm/yarn used)
- **TypeScript:** `bunx tsc --noEmit`
- **Lint:** `bun run lint` (ESLint + Prettier)
- **Build:** `bun run build` (Vite SSR)

### Results (post-correction commit `f01afcc`)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `bun run lint` | ✅ Pass — 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `bun run build` | ✅ Pass — built in 22.33s |
