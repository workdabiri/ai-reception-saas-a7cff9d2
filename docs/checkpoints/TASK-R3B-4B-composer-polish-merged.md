## 4. Implementation Summary

### Auto-Scroll

- Added auto-scroll to the bottom of the message timeline on initial load and after a successful send/refetch.
- Implemented using a `useRef<HTMLDivElement>` (`timelineEndRef`) and a scroll sentinel `<div>` placed after the message timeline but before the composer.
- Added a `messagesCount` variable derived from `messagesData?.data?.length`.
- Added a `useEffect` hook watching `messagesCount` that calls `timelineEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" })`.
- Ensured all hook declarations (`useRef` and `useEffect`) are placed before any early returns to satisfy React's Rules of Hooks.

### Character Counter

- Added a character counter below the composer textarea to help operators stay under the backend's 50,000 character limit.
- The counter is hidden by default and only visible when `content.length > 49,000`.
- Displays the current length as a locale-formatted number (e.g., "49,500 / 50,000").
- Uses `text-muted-foreground` by default, but switches to `text-destructive` when `content.length > 49,900` to serve as an immediate warning.

### Scope Control

- **No new hooks** introduced.
- **No new files** added.
- **No backend changes** made.

## 5. Explicitly Preserved/Deferred

| Feature/Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| Existing R3B-4A composer behavior | Preserved |
| Reply mode direction | Still sends `OUTBOUND` only |
| Note mode direction | Still sends `INTERNAL` only |
| Payload attributes | UI still does not send `senderType`, `senderUserId`, `senderCustomerId`, or `SYSTEM` |
| Optimistic append | Deferred |
| Status transition controls | Deferred (planned for R3B-5) |
| Assignment workflow | Deferred |
| AI draft/classification | Deferred |
| External channel delivery | Deferred |
| Attachments/file upload | Deferred |
| Rich text editor | Deferred |
| Manual smoke execution | Deferred (not executed in this checkpoint) |
